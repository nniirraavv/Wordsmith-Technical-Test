# 1. Memoizer
Write a memoization function, which takes one function as a parameter and returns a memoized version of it. The type signature of the memoized function should match that of the input function. The memoized function should be able to cache its return values internally and return the cached values in case it has been called with parameters previously used saving processing time.
### Created a file `src/memoized-function.ts` for memoized function, and also write test case(at `test/memoized-function.test.ts`) to verify the convert results.

# 3. Simple account management API
This is the Simple account management API service created using TypeScript and NodeJS.

Write a simple REST API project for account management. The data storage does not matter, you can stub out the data persistence layer within memory storage if this is easier. You are free to use any frameworks youâ€™d like. You do not need to consider authentication or encryption(either in transit or at rest). The API should allow users to create new accounts, update existing ones, delete accounts and get account information for an account entity. What data you store for an account is up to you. We recommend the usual like name, address, phone, email, etc...
